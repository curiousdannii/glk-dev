# Script to run every test I've got -- at least, all the ones whose output
# can be checked by RegTest.

# To run this:
# python ~/src/plotex/regtest.py run-all-regtests
#
# (Or wherever you've installed regtest.py. Find this script at:
# http://eblong.com/zarf/plotex/regtest.html )


# You'll probably want to change this line to refer to a CheapGlk Glulxe
# binary.
** interpreter: /Users/zarf/bin/glulxec -q -u

# RegTest really wants to have a global game file, so glulxercise is it.
# This will be changed in most of the tests.
** game: glulxercise.ulx
